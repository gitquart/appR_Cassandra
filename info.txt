# I'm sure it is, though I don't know a lot of R. There are two ways you could do it:
#   1) use the new REST/GraphQL/DocumentAPI API's
#   2) look around for an R package to directly connect to cassandra (these are often wrappers around the C or Java Driver)
# 
# I would recommend using the REST/etc API except in some very specific performance related use cases
# Note: There is no way to connect RCassandra to Datastax, the C/C++ driver is needed.
